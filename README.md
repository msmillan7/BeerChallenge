# BeerChallenge

The main objective of this notebook is to respond the following questions regarding the Beer dataset:

1.	Rank top 3 Breweries which produce the strongest beers?
2.	Which year did beers enjoy the highest ratings? 
3.	Based on the userâ€™s ratings which factors are important among taste, aroma, appearance, and palette?
4.	If you were to recommend 3 beers to your friends based on this data which ones will you recommend?
5.	Which Beer style seems to be the favorite based on reviews written by users? 
6.	How does written review compare to overall review score for the beer styles?
7.	How do find similar beer drinkers by using written reviews only?   

So explore the data and respond to the above questions, I have used some of my knowledge in different fiels, such as Sentiment Analysis, Recommender Systems and Distributed Systems.
